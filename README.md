# 🏆 Geelong Business Excellence Awards (GBEA) Review – Strategic Redesign of a Regional Awards Program

## Executive Summary
The Geelong Business Excellence Awards (GBEA) faced declining participation from mid to large businesses due to a time intensive, complex submission process that required 30+ hours to complete. As part of a consulting engagement with the Geelong Chamber of Commerce, I worked on redesigning the awards structure and submission experience to remove participation barriers, improve inclusivity, and reduce judging workload. The outcome was a two stage submission model, streamlined award categories, and a digital first roadmap designed to materially increase submissions, improve applicant experience, and make the program scalable ahead of its major relaunch at the Nyaal Banyul Convention Centre.

This project demonstrates how I approach ambiguous business problems: diagnose before prescribing, design for real user constraints, and align operational change to strategic outcomes.

## Why this problem mattered

The GBEA is one of Australia’s longest running regional business awards, but its submission process had become a strategic liability rather than an asset.

Key issues identified:  
- Entry completion times exceeding 30 hours discouraged small and time poor businesses
- Larger firms were underrepresented due to misaligned categories and effort-to-reward mismatch
- Judges faced high cognitive load from long, inconsistent submissions
- Feedback to non finalists was limited, reducing repeat participation

Left unaddressed, the awards risked shrinking relevance, declining submission volume, and reputational erosion at a time when the Chamber was planning a high profile relaunch.

## Demonstration of Skills and Capabilities

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Diagnose complex operational problems with multiple stakeholders
- Translate qualitative insight into scalable process design
- Balance inclusivity, efficiency, and strategic positioning
- Design systems with measurable business outcomes in mind
- Communicate recommendations at an executive decision making level
- These skills are directly transferable to roles in consulting, strategy, marketing operations, and analytics driven environments.

## My role and ownership

This was a team based consulting engagement. My primary responsibilities included:
- Mapping the end to end submission and judging workflow to identify friction points
- Leading benchmarking analysis against national and regional award programs
- Co-designing the two stage submission model and modular question structure
- Dveloping the KPI framework used to evaluate participation, effort reduction, and judge experience post implementation

I was accountable for translating qualitative insights into concrete process and structural changes.

## What changed as a result of this work

### **1. Submission process redesign**
**Before:**
Single stage submission requiring full completion upfront, regardless of business size or likelihood of shortlisting.

**After:**
Two stage model:
- Stage 1: Short expression of interest with 5 to 10 targeted questions
- Stage 2: Detailed submission required only for shortlisted entrants

**Why it mattered:**
Lowered initial effort barriers, increased accessibility, and reduced wasted effort for non progressing applicants.

### **2. Modular and weighted assessment structure**
**Before:**
Uniform questions applied across all businesses, disadvantaging smaller and early stage firms.

**After:**
Modular question sets with weighted scoring aligned to business size and maturity.

**Why it mattered:**
Improved fairness, comparability, and perceived legitimacy of judging outcomes.

### **3. Award category realignment**
**Before:**
20 overlapping categories with unclear differentiation.

**After:**
Consolidation into 12 strategic categories grouped by lifecycle stage and innovation focus, with dedicated recognition for sustainability, community impact, and emerging leaders.

**Why it mattered:**
Reduced complexity, improved storytelling for entrants, and lowered judging workload.

### **4. Digital first experience and feedback loop**
**Before:**
Manual submissions with limited visibility and minimal feedback for non finalists.

**After:**
Proposed digital submission dashboard with autosave, progress tracking, collaborative completion, and standardised feedback generation.

**Why it mattered:**
Improved applicant experience, judge efficiency, and long term re engagement.

## Expected Impact  
- **Increase submission volume by 25–30%** across small to large business segments.  
- **Reduce average completion time** from 30+ hours to under 10 hours.  
- Improve **judge satisfaction and turnaround time** by 40%.  
- Strengthen community perception of the awards as inclusive, innovative, and future-ready.
